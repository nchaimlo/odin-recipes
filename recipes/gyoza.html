    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Gyoza are Japanese dumplings that feature a savory filling encased in a thin, delicate 
        wrapper. Originating from China and popularized in Japan, these dumplings are typically 
        filled with a mixture of ground meat (often pork or chicken), finely chopped vegetables 
        like cabbage and scallions, and seasoned with ingredients such as garlic, ginger, soy 
        sauce, and sesame oil.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dumplings are usually cooked using a combination of pan-frying and steaming, which 
        gives them a crispy bottom and a tender, steamed top. They are often served with a 
        dipping sauce made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil, and can be enjoyed as 
        an appetizer, snack, or part of a meal. Gyoza are known for their delightful texture 
        and rich flavor, making them a favorite in Japanese cuisine and beyond.
