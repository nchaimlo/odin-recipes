        Gyoza are Japanese dumplings that feature a savory filling encased in a thin, delicate 
        wrapper. Originating from China and popularized in Japan, these dumplings are typically 
        filled with a mixture of ground meat (often pork or chicken), finely chopped vegetables 
        like cabbage and scallions, and seasoned with ingredients such as garlic, ginger, soy 
        sauce, and sesame oil.

        The dumplings are usually cooked using a combination of pan-frying and steaming, which 
        gives them a crispy bottom and a tender, steamed top. They are often served with a 
        dipping sauce made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil, and can be enjoyed as 
        an appetizer, snack, or part of a meal. Gyoza are known for their delightful texture 
        and rich flavor, making them a favorite in Japanese cuisine and beyond.
