    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Mofongo is a beloved Puerto Rican dish made from mashed plantains. The dish starts with green plantains that are fried 
        until crispy and then mashed together with garlic, olive oil, and pork cracklings (chicharr√≥n) or bacon. The result is 
        a rich, savory mash with a delightful texture that's both crispy and tender. Mofongo can be served as a side dish or as 
        a main course, often accompanied by a variety of savory options such as seafood, chicken, or stewed meats. Its deep, 
        flavorful taste and versatile nature make it a staple in Puerto Rican cuisine.
